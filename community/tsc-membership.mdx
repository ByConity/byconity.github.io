## What is the Technical Steering Committee?

### Adding or Removing committers or TSC members

The members of the TSC can hold vote for adding or removing committers or TSC members.

### Voting

- The voting is based on a one-vote per voting member basis.
- To facilitate member voting, such as when casting votes for new committers and maintainers, a minimum of two votes (excluding the nominator's vote) will be necessary for the vote to be considered successful.

### Resignation

In the event that a committee member decides to step down from their position for any personal reasons, they are required to inform the committee through a written notification.

### Removal

A TSC member may be removed by an affirmative vote of a majority of the TSC.

## How to become a TSC member

To become a TSC member, you need to become a maintainer of one of the projects in the ByConity Initiative first, and once you are voted as TSC member, you will be invited as a TSC member.

You can become a maintainer by doing the following steps within the ByConity organization:

- Support and commit to existing projects for a long time
- Be invited by other maintainers to join them as a maintainer.
