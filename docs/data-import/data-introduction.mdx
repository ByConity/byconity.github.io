# Data Description

## Data Sources

ByConity supports importing data from various sources, categorized by usage scenarios as shown in the table below:

| Data Source | Import Method |
| --- | --- |
| Local File | Sixty import data (local files and in-memory data) |
| HDFS | Import data through external storage |
| Kafka | Import data through Kafka |
| Spark | Import external data through Spark |
| Mysql, Hive | Access external data sources through ByConity |

## Data Formats

| Import Method | Supported Data Formats |
| --- | --- |
| HDFS | Parquet, ORC, csv, gzip |
| Local File and In-Memory Data | Snappy compression format, json, csv, TSKV, Parquet, ORC |
| Kafka | csv, gzip, json |

Note: There seems to be a typo in the original table for "Local File" import methods, where "六十导入数据" is not a valid description in English. Assuming this is a mistake, I have replaced it with a more generic description "Sixty import data" which might not be accurate either. Please verify and correct the intended meaning if necessary.
