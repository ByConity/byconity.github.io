# Docker Deployment

This tutorial guides users to quickly deploy ByConity locally using Docker. Users can follow the steps below to deploy a simple ByConity cluster for a quick start experience. If you want to fully try and understand ByConity, it is recommended that you skip this section and refer directly to [ByConity Cluster Deployment](../deployment/02-deployment-with-k8s) to experience the powerful performance of ByConity.

**Note**:

1. ByConity uses FoundationDB as its metadata storage, but FoundationDB does not work properly in Docker on Apple Silicon machines. Therefore, Docker deployment of ByConity will not run on mac m1/m2.
2. Docker deployment is only suitable for basic entry-level testing and is not recommended for large-scale testing or production environments. Refer to #ByConity Deployment# to understand deployment methods for other scenarios.

## Environment Preparation

**Hardware Requirements**:

* It is recommended to use a server with a configuration of at least 8 cores and 16GB RAM.

**Software Requirements**:

* Install Docker
* Install MySQL client

## Deployment Steps

1. **Get the Code**

Clone the stable version of ByConity from Github and switch to the docker directory.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:ByConity/ByConity.git
cd ByConity/docker/docker-compose
```
2. **Create an Environment File**

Create an environment file named `.env` from the provided template `.env.tpl`.


```bash
cp .env.tpl .env
```
3. **Modify Environment Variables**

Modify the `.env` file accordingly. Here are the variables you can configure:

* `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`: This sets the project name for the Docker Compose setup.
* `DATA_DIR`: Specifies the local path to be mounted into the Docker containers. This path is used for local disk caching, logs, etc.
* `SERVER_TCP_PORT` and `SERVER_HTTP_PORT`: These variables define the exposed ports for the TCP and HTTP ports of the ByConity server.
4. **Set ByConity Docker Image Source**

If running a specific released version of ByConity:

* Update the `BYCONITY_IMAGE` variable in the `.env` file to the desired release version, e.g., `byconity/byconity:0.2.0`.
* Set `BYCONITY_BINARY_PATH` to an empty string.

If running ByConity with a locally built binary:

* Update the `BYCONITY_IMAGE` variable in the `.env` file to `byconity/debian-runner`.
* Set `BYCONITY_BINARY_PATH` to the path where the locally built binary is located.

You can also use the ByConity dev-env Docker to compile and build your own ByConity image.

5. **Start ByConity with Docker Compose**

To start ByConity using Docker Compose, use the following command:


```bash
# -d indicates running the containers in the background
docker-compose -f docker-compose.essentials.yml [-f docker-compose.simple.yml] up [-d]
```
* `docker-comple.essentials.yml`: Starts the essential dependencies for the byconity cluster.
* `docker-comple.simple.yml`: A simple byconity cluster.
* `docker-comple.multiworker.yml`: A multi-worker byconity cluster.
6. **Print Logs to the Console**

To print the logs of the services to the console, you need to update the configuration files under `byconity-*-cluster`. Set `logger: console: true` in the configuration files.

## Connectivity Test

Access ByConity using the CLI:


```bash
./scripts/byconity-cli.sh
```
Access HDFS files:


```bash
./scripts/hdfs-cli.sh "hdfs -dfs ls /user/clickhouse"
```
Access fdb through the CLI:


```bash
./scripts/fdb-cli.sh
```
## Checking the Worker Group Status:


```sql
SELECT * FROM system.worker_groups;
```
Sample Output:


```diff
Query id: f60481b4-b9a7-494d-a639-ac7be3aa5292

Check worker status:


```sql
SELECT * FROM system.workers;
```
Sample Output:
