# ByConity MAC development environment

The easiest way to build a development environment on a MAC is to develop in a Docker container in vscode using the Dev Containers plugin. This way, you don't have to spend a lot of time configuring your environment.。 For more information, see [offical dev](https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/blob/master/docker/debian/dev-env/README.md)。

# Config docker

For more information, see [docker quick start in Chinese](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/02/docker-tutorial.html) and [docker quick start in English](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

In the Chinese docker quick start reference, the small difference is that you cannot use usermod or systemctl in MAC in step 5 and must replace them with the following two commands.



## create docker group ##

 ```shell 
sudo dscl . -create /Groups/docker
 ```

## add current user to Docker group

set up docker autostart in docker desktop:

## run dev-env image

Start by pulling the image

```shell 
git clone https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity.git

cd byconity/docker/debian/dev-env

# get the latest image 
make pull
```

You can start the container "byconity/dev-env" with the following command:

```bash
# run container 
make run
```

Inside the container, you can compile the ByConity code using the following commands.
The compiled binary is located in your local file system under `${BYCONITY_SOURCE}/build_dev/program`

```bash
# get submodule, otherwise the IDE reports the error include head file error

git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S /root/ByConity -B build_dev

# 64 means that 64 threads are used for building, you have to change it depending on your computer 
ninja -C build_dev clickhouse-server -j 64
```

# Config vscode #

## Install dev container

# Develop in vscode

## Open the development container in vscode

![open develop container in vscode](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YuanHanzhong/pictures/typoratyporaCleanShot%202023-11-01%20at%2012.30.05@2x.jpg)

## Connect to the Docker container

- When you use vscode for the first time, it reports many problems with header files cannot be found, as follows

## Header file cannot be found fix problem

- Now you need to go to the ~/ByConity directory of your Docker container and run the following command to download the submodules in Docker. The repository to download is quite large, so be patient and make sure your network is working properly.

- Once the module download is complete, switch to the ~/ByConity directory again and run

```shell
# get submodule, otherwise the IDE will report an include head file error 

git submodule update --init --recursive

# cmake again
cmake -S /root/ByConity -B build_dev

# 64 means that 64 threads are used for building, you need change this depending on your computer 
ninja -C build_dev clickhouse-server -j 64
```

- After the execution is finished, the problem that the header file cannot be found is solved
