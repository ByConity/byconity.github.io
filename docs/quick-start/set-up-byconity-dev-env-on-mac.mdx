# ByConity MAC development environment

The easiest way to build a development environment on a MAC is to develop in a docker container in vscode with  the Dev Containers plugin. This way you don't have to spend a lot of time configuring your environment.For more details refer to [offical dev](https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/blob/master/docker/debian/dev-env/README.md)ã€‚

# Config docker 

You may refer [docker quick start in Chinese](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/02/docker-tutorial.html) and [docker quick start in English](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) for more details.

In above Chinese docker quick start reference, the slight difference is that in step 5, since you can't use usermod or systemctl in MAC, you have to replace them with the following two command.

     # create docker group
     sudo dscl . -create /Groups/docker
     
     # add current user to docker group
     sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a $USER -t user docker

## run dev-env image

Start by pulling the image
```
git clone https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity.git 

cd byconity/docker/debian/dev-env

# get the latest image
make pull
```

You can run the "byconity/dev-env" container with the following command:
```bash
# run container
make run
```


Inside the container, you can compile the ByConity code using the following commands.
The compiled binary will be found within your local filesystem at `${BYCONITY_SOURCE}/build_dev/program`
```bash
# get submodule, otherwise the IDE will report include head file error
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S /root/ByConity -B build_dev

# 64 means use 64 threads to build, you need change it based on your computer
ninja -C build_dev clickhouse-server -j 64
```



# Config vscode

## install Dev Containers

### The first time you use vscode, it will report a lot of header file cannot be found problems, as follows

### At this point, you need to go to the ~/ByConity directory of your docker's container and execute the following command to download the submodules into docker. The repository to be downloaded is quite large, so be patient and make sure your network is working fine.

### Once the download of the module is complete, go to ~/ByConity dir again and execute 

```shell
# get submodule, otherwise the IDE will report include head file error
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S /root/ByConity -B build_dev

# 64 means use 64 threads to build, you need change it based on your computer
ninja -C build_dev clickhouse-server -j 64
```

### After the execution is complete, the above problem is solved
