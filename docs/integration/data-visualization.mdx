# Data Visualization

## Tutorial Objectives:

This document is designed to guide users in connecting and utilizing Byconity through common open-source and commercial data visualization tools.

## Prerequisites:

Users need to acquire the `HOST` and `PORT (TCP/HTTP)` information for the Byconity service.

## Currently Supported Tools

The currently supported visualization tools include:

- [Grafana](./data-visualisation#grafana)
- [Metabase](./data-visualisation#metabase)
- [SuperSet](./data-visualisation#superset)
- [Tableau](./data-visualisation#tableau)
- [Others](./data-visualisation#others)

## Connection Methods:

### Grafana

The connection method is the same as connecting to an open-source ClickHouse. Refer to:
