It involves extracting data from different sources and in various formats into a data warehouse for processing. Traditionally, the data transformation process uses Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) to convert business data into a data model suitable for data warehouses. However, this relies on an ETL system independent of the data warehouse, resulting in high maintenance costs. As a cloud-native data warehouse, ByConity has gradually supported Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) since version 0.2.0, freeing users from maintaining multiple heterogeneous data systems. This article will introduce ByConity's capabilities, implementation principles, and usage methods related to ELT.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="etl-scenarios-and-solutions">ETL Scenarios and Solutions<a href="#etl-scenarios-and-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ETL Scenarios and Solutions" title="Direct link to ETL Scenarios and Solutions">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="differences-between-elt-and-etl">Differences between ELT and ETL<a href="#differences-between-elt-and-etl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Differences between ELT and ETL" title="Direct link to Differences between ELT and ETL">​</a></h3><ul><li>ETL: Describes the process of extracting data from a source, transforming it, and loading it into a destination (data warehouse).

Compared to ETL, it requires less data modeling and provides analysts with more flexibility. ELT has become the norm in big data processing today, posing many new requirements for data warehouses.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="challenges-of-resource-duplication">Challenges of Resource Duplication<a href="#challenges-of-resource-duplication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges of Resource Duplication" title="Direct link to Challenges of Resource Duplication">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt2-caa5b7ef03a16466c984978e04735732.png" width="1048" height="402" class="img_astN"></p><p>A typical data pipeline is as follows: We ingest behavioral data, logs, clickstreams, etc., into a storage system using MQ/Kafka/Flink. The storage system can be further divided into on-premises HDFS and cloud-based OSS&amp;S3 remote storage systems. Then, a series of ETL operations are performed on the data warehouse to provide data for OLAP systems for analysis and query. However, some businesses need to branch off from the above storage, exporting data from the overall pipeline at a certain stage of data analysis to perform ETL operations different from the main pipeline, resulting in duplicate data storage. Additionally, two different ETL logics may emerge during this process.</p><p>As the amount of data increases, the cost pressure brought by computational and storage redundancy also increases. Meanwhile, the expansion of storage space makes elastic scaling inconvenient.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="industry-solutions">Industry Solutions<a href="#industry-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Industry Solutions" title="Direct link to Industry Solutions">​</a></h3><p>In the industry, there are several approaches to address the above issues:</p><ul><li>Data pre-calculation school: Tools like Kylin. If report generation in Hadoop systems is slow or aggregation capabilities are poor, data pre-calculation can be performed to calculate cubes or views in advance for configured indicators. During actual SQL queries, the cubes or views can be directly used for substitution and returned.</li><li>Streaming and batch integration school: Tools like Flink, Risingwave. Data is aggregated directly in memory for reports or large screens as it flows in. After aggregation, the results are written to HBase or MySQL for retrieval and display. Flink also exposes interfaces for intermediate states, i.e., queryable state, to enable users to better utilize state data. However, the final results still need to be reconciled with batch computation results, and if inconsistencies are found, backtracking operations may be required. The entire process tests the skills of operation and maintenance/development teams.</li><li>Data lake and warehouse integration &amp; HxxP: Combining data lakes with data warehouses.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="elt-in-byconity">ELT in ByConity<a href="#elt-in-byconity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ELT in ByConity" title="Direct link to ELT in ByConity">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="overall-execution-flow">Overall Execution Flow<a href="#overall-execution-flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overall Execution Flow" title="Direct link to Overall Execution Flow">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt3-9500640cd18aa26d9bc3357e5dd627c9.png" width="1280" height="828" class="img_astN"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="system-requirements-for-elt-tasks">System Requirements for ELT Tasks:<a href="#system-requirements-for-elt-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to System Requirements for ELT Tasks:" title="Direct link to System Requirements for ELT Tasks:">​</a></h3><ol><li>Overall scalability: Importing and transforming often require significant resources, and the system needs to scale horizontally to meet rapid data growth.</li><li>Reliability and fault tolerance: Large numbers of jobs can be scheduled orderly; in case of occasional task failures (OOM), container failures, etc., retries can be triggered; able to handle a certain degree of data skewness.</li><li>Efficiency and performance: Effective utilization of multi-core and multi-machine concurrency; fast data import; efficient memory usage (memory management); CPU optimization (vectorization, codegen).</li><li>Ecosystem and observability: Compatible with various tools; task status awareness; task progress awareness; failed log query; certain visualization capabilities.</li></ol><p>Based on the requirements of ELT tasks and the difficulties encountered in current scenarios, ByConity has added the following features and optimizations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="stage-level-scheduling">Stage-level Scheduling<a href="#stage-level-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stage-level Scheduling" title="Direct link to Stage-level Scheduling">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt4-494e04491f26b62b894e7bcea61beb89.png" width="830" height="528" class="img_astN"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="principle-analysis">Principle Analysis<a href="#principle-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Principle Analysis" title="Direct link to Principle Analysis">​</a></h4><ul><li>The current SQL execution process in ClickHouse is as follows:<ul><li>In the first stage, the Coordinator receives a distributed table query and converts it into a local table query for each shard node.</li><li>In the second stage, the Coordinator aggregates the results from each node and returns them to the client.</li></ul></li><li>ClickHouse converts the right table in Join operations into a subquery, which brings several issues that are difficult to resolve:<ul><li>Complex queries have multiple subqueries, resulting in high conversion complexity.</li><li>When the Join table is large, it can easily cause OOM in worker nodes.</li><li>Aggregation occurs at the Coordinator, putting pressure on it and easily becoming a performance bottleneck.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt5-feb79e6e129f3aeb9ab86aa2b92767f4.png" width="443" height="521" class="img_astN"> <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt6-8481e54f07ead8899937be2f068395c6.png" width="395" height="536" class="img_astN"> <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt7-306fde6a5dad86ac0bb435ce6909f7bc.png" width="320" height="231" class="img_astN"></p><p>Unlike ClickHouse, we have implemented optimization for the execution of complex queries in ByConity. By splitting the execution plan, we transform the previous two-stage execution model into stage-level execution. During the logical plan phase, exchange operators are inserted based on operator types. During the execution phase, the entire execution plan is DAG-split based on exchange operators, and scheduling is performed stage by stage. The exchange operators between stages are responsible for data transmission and exchange.
Key nodes:</p><ol><li>Insertion of exchange nodes</li><li>Splitting of stages</li><li>Stage scheduler</li><li>Segment executer</li><li>Exchange manager</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt8-91b30f3fc765792bb11ada8747fd2ec2.png" width="583" height="529" class="img_astN"></p><p>Here, we focus on the exchange perspective. As you can see in the figure above, at the top level is the query plan. When converting it to a physical plan, we transform it into different operators based on different data distribution requirements. The source layer, which receives data, is mostly unified and called ExchangeSource. Sinks have different implementations, such as BroadcastSink, Local, PartitionSink, etc., which run as part of map tasks. For cross-node data operations, we use a unified brpc streaming data transmission at the bottom level, and for local operations, we use memory queues. We have made very detailed optimizations for different points:</p><ul><li>Data transmission layer<ul><li>In-process communication uses memory queues, without serialization, zero copy</li><li>Inter-process communication uses brpc stream RPC, ensuring order preservation, connection reuse, status code transmission, compression, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Operator layer<ul><li>Batch sending</li><li>Thread reuse, reducing the number of threads</li></ul></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="benefits">Benefits<a href="#benefits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits" title="Direct link to Benefits">​</a></h4><p>Because ByConity fully adopts a multi-stage query execution approach, there are significant overall benefits:</p><ul><li>More stable and efficient Coordinator<ul><li>Aggregation and other operators are split to worker nodes for execution</li><li>The Coordinator node only needs to aggregate the final results</li></ul></li><li>Reduced Worker OOM<ul><li>Stage splitting makes each stage's computation relatively simple</li><li>The addition of exchange operators reduces memory pressure</li></ul></li><li>More stable and efficient network connections<ul><li>Effective transmission by exchange operators</li><li>Reuse of connection pools</li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="adaptive-scheduler">Adaptive Scheduler<a href="#adaptive-scheduler" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Adaptive Scheduler" title="Direct link to Adaptive Scheduler">​</a></h3><p>The Adaptive Scheduler is a feature we have implemented for stability. In OLAP scenarios, it may be found that some data is incomplete or data queries timeout, often due to the fact that each worker is shared by all queries. Once a worker is slow, it can affect the execution of the entire query.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt9-5832a9a799604adcf46d919e33a0fd48.png" width="360" height="360" class="img_astN"></p><p>Issues with shared computation nodes:</p><ul><li>The load on the node where Scan occurs is related to the amount of scan data required by different queries, and it cannot be perfectly averaged.</li><li>The resource requirements vary greatly among Plan Segments.
This leads to severe load imbalance among worker nodes. Heavily loaded worker nodes can affect the overall progress of the query. Therefore, we have implemented the following optimization solutions:</li><li>Establishment of a Worker health mechanism. The server side establishes a Worker health management class that can quickly obtain health information about the Worker Group, including CPU, memory, the number of running queries, etc.</li><li>Adaptive scheduling: Each SQL dynamically selects and controls the concurrency of computation nodes based on Worker health.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="query-queue-mechanism">Query Queue Mechanism<a href="#query-queue-mechanism" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Query Queue Mechanism" title="Direct link to Query Queue Mechanism">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt10-00e36ff14589366f30019c9a22871ed0.png" width="1280" height="1024" class="img_astN"> <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt11-7a76adabaa507e6b8502fef8764e9333.png" width="1280" height="1047" class="img_astN"></p><p>Our clusters may also experience full load situations, where all workers are unhealthy or overloaded/overloaded. In such cases, we use a query queue for optimization.
We directly implemented a manager on the server side. Each time a query is made, the manager checks the cluster's resources and holds a lock. If resources are insufficient, it waits for resources to be released before waking up the lock. This avoids the server issuing unbounded computation tasks, leading to worker node overloads and crashes.
The current implementation is relatively simple. The server is multi-instanced, and each server instance has its own queue, providing a local perspective lacking a global resource perspective. Additionally, the query status in each queue is not persisted but simply cached in memory.
In the future, we will add coordination between servers to limit query concurrency from a global perspective. We will also persist</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="async-execution">Async Execution<a href="#async-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Async Execution" title="Direct link to Async Execution">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/elt12-8734ea2851ceceb9d629659aecd68ac5.png" width="1280" height="708" class="img_astN"></p><p>A typical characteristic of ELT tasks is that their running time is relatively long compared to real-time analysis. Generally, ELT tasks can take minutes or even hours to execute.
Currently, ClickHouse's client queries are returned in a blocking manner. This results in the client remaining in a waiting state for an extended period, during which it needs to maintain a connection with the server. In unstable network conditions, the connection between the client and server may be disconnected, leading to task failures on the server side.
To reduce such unnecessary failures and reduce the complexity of maintaining connections for the client, we have developed an asynchronous execution feature, which is implemented as follows:</p><ol><li>User-specified asynchronous execution. Users can specify asynchronous execution on a per-query basis by using <code>settings enable_async_query = 1</code>. Alternatively, they can set it at the session level using <code>set enable_async_query = 1</code>.</li><li>If the query is asynchronous, it is placed in a background thread pool for execution.</li><li>Silent I/O. When an asynchronous query is executing, its interaction with the client, such as log output, needs to be severed.</li></ol><p>Initialization of the query still occurs in the session's synchronous thread. Once initialization is complete, the query state is written to the metastore, and an async query ID is returned to the client. The client can use this ID to query the status of the query. After the async query ID is returned, it indicates the completion of the interaction for this query. In this mode, if the statement is a <code>SELECT</code>, subsequent results cannot be sent back to the client. In such cases, we recommend users use a combination of async query and <code>SELECT...INTO OUTFILE</code> to meet their needs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="future-plans">Future Plans<a href="#future-plans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future Plans" title="Direct link to Future Plans">​</a></h2><p>Regarding ELT mixed loads, the ByConity 0.2.0 version is just the beginning. In subsequent versions, we will continue to optimize query-related capabilities, with ELT as the core focus. The plans are as follows:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="fault-recovery-capabilities">Fault Recovery Capabilities<a href="#fault-recovery-capabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fault Recovery Capabilities" title="Direct link to Fault Recovery Capabilities">​</a></h3><ul><li>Operator Spill<ul><li>Spill for Sort, Agg, and Join operators;</li><li>Exchange Spill capability;</li></ul></li><li>Recoverability<ul><li>Operator execution recovery: When ELT tasks run for a long time, occasional failures of intermediate tasks can lead to the failure of the entire query.

It utilizes a computing-storage separation architecture and offers various essential features, including the separation of computing and storage, elastic scalability, tenant resource isolation, and strong consistency in data reading and writing. By leveraging optimizations from popular OLAP engines like column storage, vectorized execution, MPP execution, and query optimization, ByConity delivers exceptional read and write performance.</p><h1>History of ByConity</h1><p>The origins of ByConity can be traced back to 2018 when ByteDance initially implemented ClickHouse for internal use. As the business grew, the data volume increased significantly to cater to a large user base. However, ClickHouse's Shared-Nothing architecture, where each node operates independently without sharing storage resources, posed certain challenges during its usage. Here are some of the issues encountered:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="expansion-and-contraction">Expansion and contraction:<a href="#expansion-and-contraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expansion and contraction:" title="Direct link to Expansion and contraction:">​</a></h2><p>Due to the tight coupling of computing and storage resources in ClickHouse, scaling the system incurred higher costs and involved data migration. This prevented real-time on-demand scalability, resulting in inefficient resource utilization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="multi-tenancy-and-shared-cluster-environment">Multi-tenancy and shared cluster environment:<a href="#multi-tenancy-and-shared-cluster-environment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-tenancy and shared cluster environment:" title="Direct link to Multi-tenancy and shared cluster environment:">​</a></h2><p>ClickHouse's tightly coupled architecture led to interactions among multiple tenants in a shared cluster environment. Since reading and writing operations were performed on the same node, they often interfered with each other, impacting overall performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="performance-limitations">Performance limitations:<a href="#performance-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance limitations:" title="Direct link to Performance limitations:">​</a></h2><p>ClickHouse's support for complex queries, such as multi-table join operations, was not optimal, which hindered the system's ability to handle such queries efficiently.</p><p>To address these pain points, ByteDance undertook an architectural upgrade of ClickHouse. In 2020, we initiated the ByConity project internally. After releasing the Beta version in January 2023, the project was officially made available to the public at the end of May 2023.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 1 ByteDance ClickHouse usage" src="/assets/images/f1-byte-clickhouse-usage-cefbe6a269f39c214219df180aef1560.png" width="1652" height="896" class="img_astN"></p><p>Figure 1: ByteDance ClickHouse Usage</p><h1>Features of ByConity</h1><p>ByConity implements a computing and storage separation architecture that transforms the original local management of computing and storage on individual nodes. Instead, it adopts a unified management approach for all data across the entire cluster using distributed storage. This transformation results in stateless computing nodes, enabling dynamic expansion and contraction by leveraging the scalability of distributed storage and the stateless nature of computing nodes. ByConity offers several crucial features that enhance its functionality and performance:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="storage-computing-separation">Storage-Computing Separation<a href="#storage-computing-separation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage-Computing Separation" title="Direct link to Storage-Computing Separation">​</a></h2><p>One of the critical advantages of ByConity is its storage-computing separation architecture, which enables read-write separation and elastic scaling. This architecture ensures that read and write operations do not affect each other, and computing resources and storage resources can be independently expanded and contracted on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization. ByConity also supports multi-tenant resource isolation, making it suitable for multi-tenant environments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 2: ByConity storage-computing separation to achieve multi-tenant isolation" src="/assets/images/f2-storage-computing-separation-51a4fd7a3073479cf431a48278204cd5.png" width="1203" height="561" class="img_astN">

Let's explore the interaction process of each component in ByConity throughout the complete lifecycle of a SQL query.</p><p>ByConity's working principle can be divided into three stages:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="stage-1-query-request">Stage 1: Query Request<a href="#stage-1-query-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stage 1: Query Request" title="Direct link to Stage 1: Query Request">​</a></h2><p>The client submits a Query request to the server. The server initially performs <strong>parsing</strong> and subsequently analyzes and optimizes the query through the <strong>Query Analyzer and Optimizer</strong> to generate an efficient executable plan.

The scheduler accesses the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> to obtain available computing resources and determines which nodes to schedule the query tasks for execution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="stage-3-query-execution">Stage 3: Query Execution<a href="#stage-3-query-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stage 3: Query Execution" title="Direct link to Stage 3: Query Execution">​</a></h2><p>The Query request is executed on <strong>ByConity's Workers</strong>. The Workers read data from the underlying <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> and perform computations by establishing a Pipeline. The server then aggregates the calculation results from multiple Workers and returns them to the client.</p><p>Additionally, ByConity includes two main components: <strong>Time-stamp Oracle</strong> and <strong>Daemon Manager</strong>. The time-stamp oracle supports transaction processing, while the daemon manager manages and schedules subsequent tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="main-component-library">Main Component Library<a href="#main-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Main Component Library" title="Direct link to Main Component Library">​</a></h2><p>To better understand the working principle of ByConity, let's take a look at the main components of ByConity:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="metadata-management">Metadata Management<a href="#metadata-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metadata Management" title="Direct link to Metadata Management">​</a></h3><p>ByConity offers a highly available and high-performance metadata read and write service called the Catalog Server. It supports complete transaction semantics (ACID). Furthermore, we have designed the Catalog Server with a flexible architecture, allowing for the pluggability of backend storage systems. Currently, we support Apple's open-source FoundationDB, and there is potential for extending support to other backend storage systems in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="query-optimizer">Query Optimizer<a href="#query-optimizer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Query Optimizer" title="Direct link to Query Optimizer">​</a></h3><p>The query optimizer plays a crucial role in the performance of a database system. A well-designed optimizer can significantly enhance query performance, particularly in complex query scenarios, where it can achieve performance improvements ranging from several times to hundreds of times. ByConity's self-developed optimizer focuses on improving optimization capabilities through two main approaches:</p><ul><li>RBO (Rule-Based Optimization): This capability encompasses various optimizations such as column pruning, partition pruning, expression simplification, subquery dissociation, predicate pushdown, redundant operator elimination, Outer-Join to Inner-Join conversion, operator pushdown storage, distributed operator splitting, and other heuristic optimization techniques.</li><li>CBO (Cost-Based Optimization): ByConity's optimizer also includes cost-based optimization capabilities. This includes support for join reorder, outer-join reorder, join/agg reorder, common table expressions (CTE), materialized views, dynamic filter push-down, magic set optimization, and other cost-based techniques. Additionally, it integrates property enforcement for distributed planning.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="query-scheduling">Query Scheduling<a href="#query-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Query Scheduling" title="Direct link to Query Scheduling">​</a></h3><p>ByConity currently supports two query scheduling strategies: Cache-aware scheduling and Resource-aware scheduling.</p><ul><li>The <strong>cache-aware scheduling</strong> focuses on scenarios where computing and storage are separated. Its objective is to maximize cache utilization and minimize cold reads. This strategy aims to schedule tasks to nodes that have corresponding data caches, enabling computations to leverage the cache and improve read and write performance. Additionally, considering the dynamic expansion and contraction of the system, cache-aware scheduling strives to minimize the impact of cache failure on query performance when the computing group's topology changes.</li><li><strong>Resource-aware scheduling</strong> analyzes the resource usage of different nodes within the computing group across the entire cluster. It performs targeted scheduling to optimize resource utilization. Moreover, resource-aware scheduling incorporates flow control mechanisms to ensure rational resource utilization and prevent negative effects caused by overload, such as system downtime.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="computing-group">Computing Group<a href="#computing-group" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Computing Group" title="Direct link to Computing Group">​</a></h3><p>ByConity enables different tenants to utilize distinct computing resources, as depicted in Figure 5. With ByConity's architecture, implementing features like multi-tenant isolation and read-write separation becomes straightforward. Each tenant can leverage separate computing groups to achieve multi-tenant isolation and support read-write separation. The computing groups can be dynamically expanded and contracted on-demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization. During periods of low resource utilization, resource sharing can be employed, allowing computing groups to be allocated to other tenants to maximize resource utilization and minimize costs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="virtual-file-system">Virtual File System<a href="#virtual-file-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Virtual File System" title="Direct link to Virtual File System">​</a></h3><p>The virtual file system module serves as an intermediary layer for data reading and writing. ByConity has optimized this module to provide a "storage as a service" capability to other modules. The virtual file system offers a unified file system abstraction, shielding the underlying different back-end implementations. It facilitates easy expansion and supports multiple storage systems, such as HDFS or object storage.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="cache-acceleration">Cache Acceleration<a href="#cache-acceleration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cache Acceleration" title="Direct link to Cache Acceleration">​</a></h3><p>ByConity utilizes caching to accelerate query processing. Under the computing-storage separation architecture, cache acceleration is performed in both the metadata and data dimensions. In the metadata dimension, ByConity caches Table and Partition information in the memory of the server-side (ByConity Server). In the data dimension, cache acceleration occurs on the Worker side within the computing group. This hierarchical caching mechanism utilizes both memory and disk, with Mark collection serving as the cache granularity. These caching strategies effectively enhance query speed and performance.</p><h1>How to Deploy Byconity</h1><p>ByConity currently supports four acquisition and deployment modes.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="introduction-to-byconity">Introduction to ByConity<a href="#introduction-to-byconity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction to ByConity" title="Direct link to Introduction to ByConity">​</a></h2><p>ByConity is an open-source cloud-native data warehouse that adopts a storage-computing separation architecture. It supports several key features, including separation of storage and computing, elastic expansion and contraction, isolation of tenant resources, and strong consistency of data read and write. By utilizing mainstream OLAP engine optimizations, such as column storage, vectorized execution, MPP execution, query optimization, etc., ByConity can provide excellent read and write performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="byconitys-history">ByConity's History<a href="#byconitys-history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ByConity's History" title="Direct link to ByConity's History">​</a></h2><p>The background of ByConity can be traced back to 2018 when ByteDance began to use ClickHouse internally. Due to the development of business, the scale of data has become larger and larger to serve a large number of users. However, because ClickHouse is a Shared-Nothing architecture, each node is independent and does not share storage resources, so computing resources and storage resources are tightly coupled. This leads to a higher cost of expansion and contraction, and involves data migration, which prevents real-time and on-demand expansion and contraction, resulting in a waste of resources. Furthermore, the tightly coupled architecture of ClickHouse will cause multi-tenants to interact with each other in the shared cluster. In addition, because reading and writing are completed on one node, reading and writing are affected. Finally, ClickHouse does not support performance in complex queries such as multi-table join. Based on these pain points, the ByConity project was launched in January 2020.</p><p>The ByConity team hopes to give the project back to the community and improve it through the power of open source. In January 2023, ByConity was officially open-sourced, and the beta version was released.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 1 ByteDance ClickHouse usage" src="/assets/images/f1-byte-clickhouse-usage-cefbe6a269f39c214219df180aef1560.png" width="1652" height="896" class="img_astN"></p><p>Figure 1: ByteDance ClickHouse Usage</p><h1>Features of ByConity</h1><p>ByConity has several key features that make it a powerful open-source cloud-native data warehouse.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="storage-computing-separation">Storage-Computing Separation<a href="#storage-computing-separation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage-Computing Separation" title="Direct link to Storage-Computing Separation">​</a></h2><p>One of the critical advantages of ByConity is its storage-computing separation architecture, which enables read-write separation and elastic scaling. This architecture ensures that read and write operations do not affect each other, and computing resources and storage resources can be independently expanded and contracted on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization. ByConity also supports multi-tenant resource isolation, making it suitable for multi-tenant environments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 2: ByConity storage-computing separation to achieve multi-tenant isolation" src="/assets/images/f2-storage-computing-separation-51a4fd7a3073479cf431a48278204cd5.png" width="1203" height="561" class="img_astN">

Figure 3: ByConity's architecture</p><h1>Working Principle of ByConity</h1><p>ByConity is a powerful open-source cloud-native data warehouse that adopts a storage-computing separation architecture. In this section, we will examine the working principle of ByConity and the interaction process of each component of ByConity through the complete life cycle of a SQL.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 4: ByConity internal component interaction diagram" src="/assets/images/f4-internal-component-interaction-301b3d1e7d179142c3b1ce535f1ce105.png" width="1280" height="1210" class="img_astN">
Figure 4: ByConity internal component interaction diagram</p><p>Figure 4 above is the interaction diagram of ByConity components. The dotted line in the figure indicates the inflow of a SQL, the two-way arrow in the solid line indicates the interaction within the component, and the one-way arrow indicates the data processing and output to the client.</p><p>ByConity's working principle can be divided into three stages:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="stage-1-query-request">Stage 1: Query Request<a href="#stage-1-query-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stage 1: Query Request" title="Direct link to Stage 1: Query Request">​</a></h2><p>The client submits a query request to the server, and the server first performs parsing, then analyzes and optimizes through analyzer and optimizer to generate a more efficient executable plan. Here, metadata MetaData is read, which is stored in a distributed KV. ByConity uses FoundationDB and reads the metadata through the Catalog.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="stage-2-plan-scheduling">Stage 2: Plan Scheduling<a href="#stage-2-plan-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stage 2: Plan Scheduling" title="Direct link to Stage 2: Plan Scheduling">​</a></h2><p>ByConity submits the executable plan generated by the analysis and optimizer to the scheduler (Plan Scheduler). The scheduler obtains idle computing resources by accessing the resource manager and decides which nodes to schedule query tasks for execution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="stage-3-query-execution">Stage 3: Query Execution<a href="#stage-3-query-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stage 3: Query Execution" title="Direct link to Stage 3: Query Execution">​</a></h2><p>Query requests are finally executed on ByConity's Worker, and the Worker will read data from the lowest-level Cloud storage and perform calculations by establishing a pipeline. Finally, the calculation results of multiple workers are aggregated by the server and returned to the client.</p><p>In addition to the above components, ByConity also has two main components, Time-stamp Oracle and Deamon Manager. The former ByConity supports transaction processing, and the latter manages and schedules some subsequent tasks.</p><h1>Main Component Library</h1><p>To better understand the working principle of ByConity, let's take a look at the main components of ByConity:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="metadata-management">Metadata Management<a href="#metadata-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metadata Management" title="Direct link to Metadata Management">​</a></h2><p>ByConity provides a highly available and high-performance metadata read and write service - Catalog Server. And ByConity supports complete transaction semantics (ACID). At the same time, we have made a better abstraction of the Catalog Server, making the back-end storage system pluggable. Currently, we support Apple's open-source FoundationDB, which can be expanded to support more back-end storage systems later.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="query-optimizer">Query Optimizer<a href="#query-optimizer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Query Optimizer" title="Direct link to Query Optimizer">​</a></h2><p>The query optimizer is one of the cores of the database system. A good optimizer can greatly improve query performance. ByConity's self-developed optimizer improves optimization capabilities based on two directions:</p><ul><li>RBO: Rule-Based Optimization capability. Support: column pruning, partition pruning, expression simplification, subquery disassociation, predicate pushdown, redundant operator elimination, outer-JOIN to INNER-JOIN, operator pushdown storage, distributed operator splitting, etc.</li><li>CBO: Cost-Based Optimization capability. Support: Join Reorder, Outer-Join Reorder, Join/Agg Reorder, CTE, Materialized View, Dynamic Filter Push-Down, Magic Set, and other cost-based optimization capabilities. And integrate Property Enforcement for distributed planning.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="query-scheduling">Query Scheduling<a href="#query-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Query Scheduling" title="Direct link to Query Scheduling">​</a></h2><p>ByConity currently supports two query scheduling strategies: Cache-aware scheduling and Resource-aware scheduling.</p><ul><li>The cache-aware scheduling policy is aimed at scenarios where storage and computing are separated, aiming to maximize the use of the cache and avoid cold reads.

At the same time, it also performs flow control to ensure reasonable use of resources and avoid negative effects caused by overload, such as system downtime.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="computing-group">Computing Group<a href="#computing-group" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Computing Group" title="Direct link to Computing Group">​</a></h2><p>ByConity supports different tenants to use different computing resources. Under ByConity's new architecture, it is easy to implement features such as multi-tenant isolation and read-write separation. Different tenants can use different computing groups to achieve multi-tenant isolation and support read-write separation. Due to the convenient expansion and contraction, the computing group can be dynamically expanded and contracted on demand to ensure efficient resource utilization. When resource utilization is not high, resource sharing can be carried out, and computing groups can be seconded to other tenants to maximize resource utilization and reduce costs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="virtual-file-system">Virtual File System<a href="#virtual-file-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Virtual File System" title="Direct link to Virtual File System">​</a></h2><p>The virtual file system module is used as the middle layer of data reading and writing. ByConity has made a better package, exposing storage as a service to other modules to realize "storage as a service". The virtual file system provides a unified file system abstraction, shields different back-end implementations, facilitates expansion, and supports multiple storage systems, such as HDFS or object storage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="cache-acceleration">Cache Acceleration<a href="#cache-acceleration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cache Acceleration" title="Direct link to Cache Acceleration">​</a></h2><p>ByConity performs query acceleration through caching. Under the architecture of separating storage and computing, ByConity performs cache acceleration in both metadata and data dimensions. In the metadata dimension, by caching in the memory of ByConity's Server side, table, and partition are used as granularity. In the data dimension, ByConity's Worker side, that is, the computing group, is used for caching, and the cache on the Worker side is hierarchical. At the same time, memory and disk are used, and the mark set is used as the cache granularity, thereby effectively improving the query speed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="how-to-obtain-and-deploy">How to Obtain and Deploy<a href="#how-to-obtain-and-deploy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Obtain and Deploy" title="Direct link to How to Obtain and Deploy">​</a></h2><p>ByConity currently supports four acquisition and deployment modes. Community developers are welcome to use them and submit issues to us:</p><ul><li>Stand-alone version<ul><li>Use docker compose to pull up Reference: <a href="https://github.com/ByConity/byconity-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ByConity/byconity-docker</a></li></ul></li><li>K8s cluster version mode<ul><li>Use K8s deployment reference: <a href="https://github.com/ByConity/byconity-deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ByConity/byconity-deploy</a></li></ul></li><li>Physical machine deployment mode<ul><li>Deploy on a physical machine using the package manager: <a href="https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/tree/master/packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/tree/master/packages</a></li></ul></li><li>Source code compilation method<ul><li>Reference: <a href="https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity#build-byconity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity#build-byconity</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_l3HI" id="byconitys-future-open-source-plan">ByConity's Future Open-Source Plan<a href="#byconitys-future-open-source-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ByConity's Future Open-Source Plan" title="Direct link to ByConity's Future Open-Source Plan">​</a></h2><p>ByConity includes several key milestones in its open-source community roadmap through 2023. These milestones are designed to enhance ByConity's functionality, performance, and ease of use. Among them, the development of new storage engines, support for more data types, and integration with other data management tools are some important areas of focus. We have listed the following directions, and we have created an issue on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/issues/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/issues/26</a>, inviting community partners to join us to discuss co-construction:</p><ul><li>In terms of performance improvement: ByConity hopes to continue to improve performance, and here are three technical directions. One is to use indexes for acceleration, which includes four aspects:<ul><li>Optimize the existing skip index;</li><li>Explore the implementation of new index research, such as zorder-index and inverted index;</li><li>ByConity builds and accelerates Hive table indexes</li><li>Index recommendation and conversion, lowering the threshold for users to use
The second is the continuous optimization of the query optimizer; the third is that ByConity's cache mechanism is local, and each computing group can only access its own cache. In the future, it is hoped to implement a distributed cache mechanism to further improve the cache hit rate.</li></ul></li><li>Stability improvement: There are two aspects here. One is to support resource isolation in more dimensions. Currently, it only supports resource isolation in the computing group dimension. In the next step, resource isolation will also be supported on the server side, providing better end-to-end Guaranteed multi-tenancy capability. The second direction is to enrich metrics and improve observability and problem diagnosis capabilities.</li><li>Enterprise-level feature enhancements: We hope to achieve more detailed permission control, including column-level permission control. The other is to improve the functions related to data security, such as data backup and recovery and data end-to-end encryption. Finally, we continue to explore the deep compression of data to save storage costs.</li><li>Ecological compatibility improvement: This direction is the most important point. ByConity plans to support more types of storage backends, such as AWS's S3, Volcano Engine's object storage, etc. In terms of improving ecological compatibility, it includes integration with some drivers and some open source software. At the same time, we also hope to support federated queries of data lakes, such as Hudi, Iceberg, etc.</li></ul><p>In short, ByConity is an open source cloud-native data warehouse that provides read-write separation, elastic expansion and contraction, tenant resource isolation, and strong consistency of data read and write.
