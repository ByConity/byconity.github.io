Figure 3: ByConity's architecture</p><h1>Working Principle of ByConity</h1><p>ByConity is a powerful open-source cloud-native data warehouse that adopts a storage-computing separation architecture. In this section, we will examine the working principle of ByConity and the interaction process of each component of ByConity through the complete life cycle of a SQL.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 4: ByConity internal component interaction diagram" src="/zh-cn/assets/images/f4-internal-component-interaction-301b3d1e7d179142c3b1ce535f1ce105.png" width="1280" height="1210" class="img_Ne1E">
Figure 4: ByConity internal component interaction diagram</p><p>Figure 4 depicts the interaction diagram of ByConity's components. In the figure, the dotted line represents the inflow of a SQL query, the double-headed arrow indicates component interaction, and the one-way arrow represents data processing and output to the client. Let's explore the interaction process of each component in ByConity throughout the complete lifecycle of a SQL query.</p><p>ByConity's working principle can be divided into three stages:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="stage-1-query-request">Stage 1: Query Request<a href="#stage-1-query-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Stage 1: Query Request的直接链接" title="Stage 1: Query Request的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The client submits a Query request to the server. The server initially performs <strong>parsing</strong> and subsequently analyzes and optimizes the query through the <strong>Query Analyzer and Optimizer</strong> to generate an efficient executable plan. To access the required <strong>metadata</strong>, which is stored in a distributed key-value (KV) store, ByConity leverages <strong>FoundationDB</strong> and reads the metadata from the <strong>Catalog</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="stage-2-plan-scheduling">Stage 2: Plan Scheduling<a href="#stage-2-plan-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Stage 2: Plan Scheduling的直接链接" title="Stage 2: Plan Scheduling的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>ByConity passes the optimized executable plan to the <strong>Plan Scheduler</strong> component. The scheduler accesses the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> to obtain available computing resources and determines which nodes to schedule the query tasks for execution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="stage-3-query-execution">Stage 3: Query Execution<a href="#stage-3-query-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Stage 3: Query Execution的直接链接" title="Stage 3: Query Execution的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The Query request is executed on <strong>ByConity's Workers</strong>. The Workers read data from the underlying <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> and perform computations by establishing a Pipeline. The server then aggregates the calculation results from multiple Workers and returns them to the client.</p><p>Additionally, ByConity includes two main components: <strong>Time-stamp Oracle</strong> and <strong>Daemon Manager</strong>. The time-stamp oracle supports transaction processing, while the daemon manager manages and schedules subsequent tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="main-component-library">Main Component Library<a href="#main-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Main Component Library的直接链接" title="Main Component Library的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>To better understand the working principle of ByConity, let's take a look at the main components of ByConity:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="metadata-management">Metadata Management<a href="#metadata-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Metadata Management的直接链接" title="Metadata Management的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity offers a highly available and high-performance metadata read and write service called the Catalog Server. It supports complete transaction semantics (ACID). Furthermore, we have designed the Catalog Server with a flexible architecture, allowing for the pluggability of backend storage systems. Currently, we support Apple's open-source FoundationDB, and there is potential for extending support to other backend storage systems in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="query-optimizer">Query Optimizer<a href="#query-optimizer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Query Optimizer的直接链接" title="Query Optimizer的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The query optimizer plays a crucial role in the performance of a database system. A well-designed optimizer can significantly enhance query performance, particularly in complex query scenarios, where it can achieve performance improvements ranging from several times to hundreds of times. ByConity's self-developed optimizer focuses on improving optimization capabilities through two main approaches:</p><ul><li>RBO (Rule-Based Optimization): This capability encompasses various optimizations such as column pruning, partition pruning, expression simplification, subquery dissociation, predicate pushdown, redundant operator elimination, Outer-Join to Inner-Join conversion, operator pushdown storage, distributed operator splitting, and other heuristic optimization techniques.</li><li>CBO (Cost-Based Optimization): ByConity's optimizer also includes cost-based optimization capabilities. This includes support for join reorder, outer-join reorder, join/agg reorder, common table expressions (CTE), materialized views, dynamic filter push-down, magic set optimization, and other cost-based techniques. Additionally, it integrates property enforcement for distributed planning.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="query-scheduling">Query Scheduling<a href="#query-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Query Scheduling的直接链接" title="Query Scheduling的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity currently supports two query scheduling strategies: Cache-aware scheduling and Resource-aware scheduling.</p><ul><li>The <strong>cache-aware scheduling</strong> focuses on scenarios where computing and storage are separated. Its objective is to maximize cache utilization and minimize cold reads. This strategy aims to schedule tasks to nodes that have corresponding data caches, enabling computations to leverage the cache and improve read and write performance. Additionally, considering the dynamic expansion and contraction of the system, cache-aware scheduling strives to minimize the impact of cache failure on query performance when the computing group's topology changes.</li><li><strong>Resource-aware scheduling</strong> analyzes the resource usage of different nodes within the computing group across the entire cluster. It performs targeted scheduling to optimize resource utilization. Moreover, resource-aware scheduling incorporates flow control mechanisms to ensure rational resource utilization and prevent negative effects caused by overload, such as system downtime.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="computing-group">Computing Group<a href="#computing-group" class="hash-link" aria-label="Computing Group的直接链接" title="Computing Group的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity enables different tenants to utilize distinct computing resources, as depicted in Figure 5. With ByConity's architecture, implementing features like multi-tenant isolation and read-write separation becomes straightforward. Each tenant can leverage separate computing groups to achieve multi-tenant isolation and support read-write separation. The computing groups can be dynamically expanded and contracted on-demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization. During periods of low resource utilization, resource sharing can be employed, allowing computing groups to be allocated to other tenants to maximize resource utilization and minimize costs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="virtual-file-system">Virtual File System<a href="#virtual-file-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Virtual File System的直接链接" title="Virtual File System的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The virtual file system module serves as an intermediary layer for data reading and writing. ByConity has optimized this module to provide a "storage as a service" capability to other modules. The virtual file system offers a unified file system abstraction, shielding the underlying different back-end implementations. It facilitates easy expansion and supports multiple storage systems, such as HDFS or object storage.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="cache-acceleration">Cache Acceleration<a href="#cache-acceleration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Cache Acceleration的直接链接" title="Cache Acceleration的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity utilizes caching to accelerate query processing. Under the computing-storage separation architecture, cache acceleration is performed in both the metadata and data dimensions. In the metadata dimension, ByConity caches Table and Partition information in the memory of the server-side (ByConity Server). In the data dimension, cache acceleration occurs on the Worker side within the computing group. This hierarchical caching mechanism utilizes both memory and disk, with Mark collection serving as the cache granularity. These caching strategies effectively enhance query speed and performance.</p><h1>How to Deploy Byconity</h1><p>ByConity currently supports four acquisition and deployment modes.

Figure 4: ByConity internal component interaction diagram</p><p>Figure 4 depicts the interaction diagram of ByConity's components. In the figure, the dotted line represents the inflow of a SQL query, the double-headed arrow indicates component interaction, and the one-way arrow represents data processing and output to the client. Let's explore the interaction process of each component in ByConity throughout the complete lifecycle of a SQL query.</p><p>ByConity's working principle can be divided into three stages:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="stage-1-query-request">Stage 1: Query Request<a href="#stage-1-query-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Stage 1: Query Request的直接链接" title="Stage 1: Query Request的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The client submits a Query request to the server. The server initially performs <strong>parsing</strong> and subsequently analyzes and optimizes the query through the <strong>Query Analyzer and Optimizer</strong> to generate an efficient executable plan. To access the required <strong>metadata</strong>, which is stored in a distributed key-value (KV) store, ByConity leverages <strong>FoundationDB</strong> and reads the metadata from the <strong>Catalog</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="stage-2-plan-scheduling">Stage 2: Plan Scheduling<a href="#stage-2-plan-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Stage 2: Plan Scheduling的直接链接" title="Stage 2: Plan Scheduling的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>ByConity passes the optimized executable plan to the <strong>Plan Scheduler</strong> component. The scheduler accesses the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> to obtain available computing resources and determines which nodes to schedule the query tasks for execution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="stage-3-query-execution">Stage 3: Query Execution<a href="#stage-3-query-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Stage 3: Query Execution的直接链接" title="Stage 3: Query Execution的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The Query request is executed on <strong>ByConity's Workers</strong>. The Workers read data from the underlying <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> and perform computations by establishing a Pipeline. The server then aggregates the calculation results from multiple Workers and returns them to the client.</p><p>Additionally, ByConity includes two main components: <strong>Time-stamp Oracle</strong> and <strong>Daemon Manager</strong>. The time-stamp oracle supports transaction processing, while the daemon manager manages and schedules subsequent tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="main-component-library">Main Component Library<a href="#main-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Main Component Library的直接链接" title="Main Component Library的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>To better understand the working principle of ByConity, let's take a look at the main components of ByConity:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="metadata-management">Metadata Management<a href="#metadata-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Metadata Management的直接链接" title="Metadata Management的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity offers a highly available and high-performance metadata read and write service called the Catalog Server. It supports complete transaction semantics (ACID). Furthermore, we have designed the Catalog Server with a flexible architecture, allowing for the pluggability of backend storage systems. Currently, we support Apple's open-source FoundationDB, and there is potential for extending support to other backend storage systems in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="query-optimizer">Query Optimizer<a href="#query-optimizer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Query Optimizer的直接链接" title="Query Optimizer的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The query optimizer plays a crucial role in the performance of a database system. A well-designed optimizer can significantly enhance query performance, particularly in complex query scenarios, where it can achieve performance improvements ranging from several times to hundreds of times. ByConity's self-developed optimizer focuses on improving optimization capabilities through two main approaches:</p><ul><li>RBO (Rule-Based Optimization): This capability encompasses various optimizations such as column pruning, partition pruning, expression simplification, subquery dissociation, predicate pushdown, redundant operator elimination, Outer-Join to Inner-Join conversion, operator pushdown storage, distributed operator splitting, and other heuristic optimization techniques.</li><li>CBO (Cost-Based Optimization): ByConity's optimizer also includes cost-based optimization capabilities. This includes support for join reorder, outer-join reorder, join/agg reorder, common table expressions (CTE), materialized views, dynamic filter push-down, magic set optimization, and other cost-based techniques. Additionally, it integrates property enforcement for distributed planning.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="query-scheduling">Query Scheduling<a href="#query-scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Query Scheduling的直接链接" title="Query Scheduling的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity currently supports two query scheduling strategies: Cache-aware scheduling and Resource-aware scheduling.</p><ul><li>The <strong>cache-aware scheduling</strong> focuses on scenarios where computing and storage are separated. Its objective is to maximize cache utilization and minimize cold reads. This strategy aims to schedule tasks to nodes that have corresponding data caches, enabling computations to leverage the cache and improve read and write performance. Additionally, considering the dynamic expansion and contraction of the system, cache-aware scheduling strives to minimize the impact of cache failure on query performance when the computing group's topology changes.</li><li><strong>Resource-aware scheduling</strong> analyzes the resource usage of different nodes within the computing group across the entire cluster. It performs targeted scheduling to optimize resource utilization. Moreover, resource-aware scheduling incorporates flow control mechanisms to ensure rational resource utilization and prevent negative effects caused by overload, such as system downtime.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="computing-group">Computing Group<a href="#computing-group" class="hash-link" aria-label="Computing Group的直接链接" title="Computing Group的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity enables different tenants to utilize distinct computing resources, as depicted in Figure 5. With ByConity's architecture, implementing features like multi-tenant isolation and read-write separation becomes straightforward. Each tenant can leverage separate computing groups to achieve multi-tenant isolation and support read-write separation. The computing groups can be dynamically expanded and contracted on-demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization. During periods of low resource utilization, resource sharing can be employed, allowing computing groups to be allocated to other tenants to maximize resource utilization and minimize costs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="virtual-file-system">Virtual File System<a href="#virtual-file-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Virtual File System的直接链接" title="Virtual File System的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The virtual file system module serves as an intermediary layer for data reading and writing. ByConity has optimized this module to provide a "storage as a service" capability to other modules. The virtual file system offers a unified file system abstraction, shielding the underlying different back-end implementations. It facilitates easy expansion and supports multiple storage systems, such as HDFS or object storage.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="cache-acceleration">Cache Acceleration<a href="#cache-acceleration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Cache Acceleration的直接链接" title="Cache Acceleration的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>ByConity utilizes caching to accelerate query processing. Under the computing-storage separation architecture, cache acceleration is performed in both the metadata and data dimensions. In the metadata dimension, ByConity caches Table and Partition information in the memory of the server-side (ByConity Server). In the data dimension, cache acceleration occurs on the Worker side within the computing group. This hierarchical caching mechanism utilizes both memory and disk, with Mark collection serving as the cache granularity. These caching strategies effectively enhance query speed and performance.</p><h1>How to Deploy Byconity</h1><p>ByConity currently supports four acquisition and deployment modes.

It supports several key features, including separation of storage and computing, elastic expansion and contraction, isolation of tenant resources, and strong consistency of data read and write. By utilizing mainstream OLAP engine optimizations, such as column storage, vectorized execution, MPP execution, query optimization, etc., ByConity can provide excellent read and write performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="byconitys-history">ByConity's History<a href="#byconitys-history" class="hash-link" aria-label="ByConity's History的直接链接" title="ByConity's History的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The background of ByConity can be traced back to 2018 when ByteDance began to use ClickHouse internally. Due to the development of business, the scale of data has become larger and larger to serve a large number of users. However, because ClickHouse is a Shared-Nothing architecture, each node is independent and does not share storage resources, so computing resources and storage resources are tightly coupled. This leads to a higher cost of expansion and contraction, and involves data migration, which prevents real-time and on-demand expansion and contraction, resulting in a waste of resources. Furthermore, the tightly coupled architecture of ClickHouse will cause multi-tenants to interact with each other in the shared cluster. In addition, because reading and writing are completed on one node, reading and writing are affected. Finally, ClickHouse does not support performance in complex queries such as multi-table join. Based on these pain points, the ByConity project was launched in January 2020.</p><p>The ByConity team hopes to give the project back to the community and improve it through the power of open source. In January 2023, ByConity was officially open-sourced, and the beta version was released.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 1 ByteDance ClickHouse usage" src="/zh-cn/assets/images/f1-byte-clickhouse-usage-cefbe6a269f39c214219df180aef1560.png" width="1652" height="896" class="img_Ne1E"></p><p>Figure 1: ByteDance ClickHouse Usage</p><h1>Features of ByConity</h1><p>ByConity has several key features that make it a powerful open-source cloud-native data warehouse.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="storage-computing-separation">Storage-Computing Separation<a href="#storage-computing-separation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Storage-Computing Separation的直接链接" title="Storage-Computing Separation的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>One of the critical advantages of ByConity is its storage-computing separation architecture, which enables read-write separation and elastic scaling.

ByConity also supports multi-tenant resource isolation, making it suitable for multi-tenant environments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 2: ByConity storage-computing separation to achieve multi-tenant isolation" src="/zh-cn/assets/images/f2-storage-computing-separation-51a4fd7a3073479cf431a48278204cd5.png" width="1203" height="561" class="img_Ne1E">

Under ByConity's new architecture, it is easy to implement features such as multi-tenant isolation and read-write separation. Different tenants can use different computing groups to achieve multi-tenant isolation and support read-write separation. Due to the convenient expansion and contraction, the computing group can be dynamically expanded and contracted on demand to ensure efficient resource utilization. When resource utilization is not high, resource sharing can be carried out, and computing groups can be seconded to other tenants to maximize resource utilization and reduce costs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="virtual-file-system">Virtual File System<a href="#virtual-file-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Virtual File System的直接链接" title="Virtual File System的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The virtual file system module is used as the middle layer of data reading and writing.

In the data dimension, ByConity's Worker side, that is, the computing group, is used for caching, and the cache on the Worker side is hierarchical. At the same time, memory and disk are used, and the mark set is used as the cache granularity, thereby effectively improving the query speed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_kuKB" id="how-to-obtain-and-deploy">How to Obtain and Deploy<a href="#how-to-obtain-and-deploy" class="hash-link" aria-label="How to Obtain and Deploy的直接链接" title="How to Obtain and Deploy的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>ByConity currently supports four acquisition and deployment modes.

These milestones are designed to enhance ByConity's functionality, performance, and ease of use. Among them, the development of new storage engines, support for more data types, and integration with other data management tools are some important areas of focus. We have listed the following directions, and we have created an issue on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/issues/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/issues/26</a>, inviting community partners to join us to discuss co-construction:</p><ul><li>In terms of performance improvement: ByConity hopes to continue to improve performance, and here are three technical directions. One is to use indexes for acceleration, which includes four aspects:<ul><li>Optimize the existing skip index;</li><li>Explore the implementation of new index research, such as zorder-index and inverted index;</li><li>ByConity builds and accelerates Hive table indexes</li><li>Index recommendation and conversion, lowering the threshold for users to use
The second is the continuous optimization of the query optimizer; the third is that ByConity's cache mechanism is local, and each computing group can only access its own cache. In the future, it is hoped to implement a distributed cache mechanism to further improve the cache hit rate.</li></ul></li><li>Stability improvement: There are two aspects here. One is to support resource isolation in more dimensions. Currently, it only supports resource isolation in the computing group dimension. In the next step, resource isolation will also be supported on the server side, providing better end-to-end Guaranteed multi-tenancy capability. The second direction is to enrich metrics and improve observability and problem diagnosis capabilities.</li><li>Enterprise-level feature enhancements: We hope to achieve more detailed permission control, including column-level permission control. The other is to improve the functions related to data security, such as data backup and recovery and data end-to-end encryption. Finally, we continue to explore the deep compression of data to save storage costs.</li><li>Ecological compatibility improvement: This direction is the most important point. ByConity plans to support more types of storage backends, such as AWS's S3, Volcano Engine's object storage, etc. In terms of improving ecological compatibility, it includes integration with some drivers and some open source software. At the same time, we also hope to support federated queries of data lakes, such as Hudi, Iceberg, etc.</li></ul><p>In short, ByConity is an open source cloud-native data warehouse that provides read-write separation, elastic expansion and contraction, tenant resource isolation, and strong consistency of data read and write. Its storage-computing separation architecture, combined with mainstream OLAP engine optimization, ensures excellent read and write performance. As ByConity continues to develop and improve, it is expected to become an important tool for cloud-native data warehouses in the future.</p><p>We have a video that introduces ByConity in detail, including a demo of ByConity.
