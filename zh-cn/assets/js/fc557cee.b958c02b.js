Performance is a very important factor when choosing an OLAP engine. Therefore, this article aims to offer valuable insights by conducting a performance comparison among four prominent open-source OLAP engines: ClickHouse, Doris, Presto, and ByConity. To achieve this, we employ a set of 99 query statements sourced from the TPC-DS benchmark. Our aim is to provide reference for enterprises in their journey to select the most fitting OLAP engine for their specific needs.","permalink":"/zh-cn/docs/0.2.0/benchmarks/2023-09-13-byconity-tpcds-benchmark-olap/2023-09-13-byconity-vs-other-olap-engines-tpc-ds-benchmarks"}]}')}}]);
