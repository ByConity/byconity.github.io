We found that there are differences in the performance of the four engines under different query scenarios. ByConity performs well in all 99 query scenarios of TPC-DS, surpassing the other three OLAP engines. Presto and Doris exhibited their strengths in join queries, aggregate queries, and window function scenarios, contrasting with ClickHouse's performance, which showed some limitations in optimizing multi-table associative queries.\nIt should be noted that the performance test results depend on multiple factors, including data structure, query type, data model, etc. In practical applications, various factors need to be considered comprehensively to choose the most suitable OLAP engine.\nWhen choosing an OLAP engine, factors such as scalability, ease of use, stability, etc. need to be considered. In practical scenarios, tailoring the selection to meet specific business requirements and reasonably configuring and optimizing the chosen engine are crucial steps to attain optimal performance.\nIn short, ClickHouse, Doris, Presto, and ByConity are all excellent OLAP engines, each with its unique strengths and applicable scenarios. In practice, the choice should be guided by the specifics of the business needs, coupled with reasonable configuration and optimization. Moreover, selecting representative query scenarios and datasets and conducting comprehensive testing and analysis across different query scenarios is imperative for a holistic evaluation of engine performance."),(0,r.kt)("h1",{id:"join-the-community"},"Join the Community"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The ByConity community boasts a thriving user base and maintains a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
