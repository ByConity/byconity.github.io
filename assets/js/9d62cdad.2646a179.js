It also has good performance, with a single TSO node supporting over 1 million QPS.

To avoid the loss of timestamps caused by TSO downtime, the timestamps need to be persisted. However, if the timing is persisted every time, performance will be reduced. Thus, TSO pre-applies for an allocatable time window (e.g., 3 seconds). After the application is successful, TSO can directly allocate all timestamps within the 3-second window in memory. When a client requests a timestamp, the logical clock part is incremented with the request. If there is an overflow in the logical part, it will sleep for 50ms and wait for the physical clock to be advanced. TSO checks the clock every 50ms. If the physical clock of the current TSO is behind the current time, the physical clock part of the TSO needs to be updated to the current physical time. If the logical clock is more than half, the physical clock of TSO will also be increased. Once the physical clock increases, the logical clock will be cleared.
